## Adapting for other languages

This project can easily be made to work with other language pairs. In the `data` folder there is a json file with an array of 1000 objects, each with an `english` and a `dutch` key.
The functions that generate questions can take `fromLanguage` and `toLanguage` parameters and can thus use any data structures that conform to this format.
